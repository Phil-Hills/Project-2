# Stock Predicting Notebook

# Project 2

# Goal
The purpose of the project was to aim to evaluate different technical indicators and machine learning models to improve trading strategies by using SVM, Logistic Regression, SMA, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and RSI as features to help us predict a stock worth investing.
In conclusion, machine learning of historical stock price time series using different technical innovations can provide support for picking trading signals

Imported stock pricing data with the ALPACA API Key
Setup and generate the trading signals
Generating features are target sets
Split the data into training and testing datasets
Incorporate the SVM machine learning into the trading strategy
Backtesting the machine learning trading algorithm
Add and train the Logistic Regression machine learning model
Backtest the Logistic Regression model using the testing data to evaluate its performance

# Next Steps
Test trading signals using MACD, Bollinger Bands, and RSI for cumulative returns using historical data

Our notebook can also be best seen by running it in Google Colab.
